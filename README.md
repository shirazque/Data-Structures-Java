As someone with a strong Python background attempting to learn Java, this project aims to explore Java's
functionality by implementing various data structures (linked) through  Object-Oriented Programming 
principles. I will be updating these files as I gain more experience in Java programming over time. I have
personally  authored all data structure implementations, including their methods and accompanying
documentation.

This project folder includes the Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Doubly Linked List, and Binary Search Tree 
(BST) ADTs.

To view the main project files, navigate to `src` -> `data_structures`. The `data_structures` folder contains the data structure implementations and their corresponding test files (authored by me), along with txt files that display the output of those tests.

I have made the Stack, Queue, and Priority Queue ADTs rudimentary, as their primary functions are to insert
and remove data in a systematic order. In contrast, Lists and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are more flexible
and are explicitly designed to support more complex operations, such as searching, sorting, and reversing.
