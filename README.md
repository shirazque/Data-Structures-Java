As someone with a strong Python background transitioning to Java, this project explores Java's functionality by implementing various linked data structures through Object-Oriented Programming principles. I have personally authored all data structure implementations, including their methods and accompanying documentation.

This project folder includes the Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Doubly Linked List, and Binary Search Tree (BST) ADTs.

To view the main project files, navigate to 'src' -> 'data_structures'. The 'data_structures' folder contains the data structure implementations and their corresponding test files (authored by me), along with txt files displaying the output of those tests.

If you intend to use my Data Structures and call their methods, please ensure that your variable declarations align with the provided method signatures to avoid syntax errors. If an invalid parameter is entered, the method should either return null or not run at all.

I have kept the Stack, Queue, and Priority Queue ADTs rudimentary, as their primary functions are to insert and remove data in a systematic order. In contrast, Lists and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are more flexible and are explicitly designed to support more complex operations such as searching, sorting, and reversing.
